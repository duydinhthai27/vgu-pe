## Project: Online Library Management System
## Project Overview
### 1. Project Description
The online library management system project aims to streamline library operations, improve the user experience, and enhance access to library resources. It automates tasks such as book cataloging, tracking, and borrowing while offering user-friendly interfaces for staff and patrons. The system increases operational efficiency, improves accessibility, and provides a centralized platform for managing library resources.
### 2. Project Set up and Configuration
#### **Docker** 
 Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. <br>

Front-end: 127.0.0.1:8888 <br>
Back-end: 127.0.0.1:6868 <br>
 #### **API**
 API stands for Application Programming Interface. It defines the rules and protocols for different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs enable modularity, system integration, flexibility, standardization, and encourage innovation in software development. <br>

#### **Model-View-Controller**
 Model-View-Controller is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three components: the model (data and logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user input and updates the model). It promotes modularity, code reusability, and testability.
